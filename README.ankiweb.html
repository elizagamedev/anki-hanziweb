This addon generates a “web” of hanzi/kanji amongst your Anki notes, adding a few examples taken from cards you’ve already reviewed for each hanzi in each note. The intent is that you’ll be able to more easily learn the readings of hanzi if you are reminded of other words it comprises that you’ve already studied.

<b>Installation</b>

Follow the instructions in the <b>Download</b> section below. You may alternatively download it from the <a href="https://github.com/elizagamedev/anki-hanziweb/releases">GitHub releases page</a>, then install in Anki via <code>Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Install from file…</code>.

<b>Configuration</b>

You can configure Hanzi Web through Anki after installing via <code>Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Hanzi Web -&gt; Config</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/elizagamedev/anki-hanziweb/blob/main/config.md">config.md</a>.

You may want to also configure the CSS of your notes, as Hanzi Web does no styling by default. It instead exposes three CSS classes:
<ul>
<li><code>ol.hanziewb</code>, applied to the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> which contains each entry.</li>
<li><code>span.hanziweb-hanzi</code>, which is the hanzi for which terms are listed (the left side of the screenshot shown above).</li>
<li><code>span.hanziweb-terms</code>, which contains the entire list of terms (the right side of the screenshot shown above).</li>
</ul>
The styling in the above screenshot was achieved with the following CSS. You may copy it into your note type’s CSS if you wish.

<code>ol.hanziweb {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 10px auto;
  font-size: 20px;
  max-width: 400px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: gray;
  border-width: 1px;
  padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;
}

.hanziweb-hanzi {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-right: 20px;
  font-size: 30px;
  font-family: serif;
}</code>

<b>Usage</b>

Ensure that the note types of the notes you want to add web entries to have a field called “HanziWeb” (without quotes). Also ensure that you’ve configured Hanzi Web as described in the <b>Configuration</b> section, so that you are including the correct cards and using the hanzi from the correct fields. Make sure that you add <code>{{HanziWeb}}</code> to your cards’ HTML templates as well.

Now you can add web entries to your notes by accessing <code>Tools -&gt; Hanzi Web -&gt; Update notes…</code> or by pressing <code>Control-W</code> (<code>Command-W</code> on macOS). A dialog with a report of the pending changes will be shown; you’ll want to consider this carefully if it’s your first time running Hanzi Web or if you’ve recently changed your configuration to make sure that you haven’t made any mistakes. Click “Apply” and your notes’ “HanziWeb” fields will be filled!
