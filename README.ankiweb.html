This addon generates a “web” of hanzi/kanji amongst your Anki notes, adding a few examples taken from cards you’ve already reviewed for each hanzi in each note. The intent is that you’ll be able to more easily learn the readings of hanzi if you are reminded of other words it comprises that you’ve already studied.

Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/elizagamedev/anki-hanziweb">GitHub page</a> for more detailed documentation.
